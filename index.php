				<p>The &Delta;REM ("DeltaREM") Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) is a summer program for undergraduate students to work collaboratively on brain
				dynamics research projects related to epilepsy and memory. Students will be integrated into ongoing research projects in state-of- the-art facilities and 
				an environment of peer and interinstitutional mentoring and collaboration.</p>
				<p>This intensive summer REU program prepares undergraduate students interested in working at the interface between biology, engineering and 
				mathematics for the rigors of graduate studies and research on human and animal brain at the molecular, cellular and neuronal network levels. The 
				program provides strong educational and career advancing opportunities, with hands-on graduate level laboratory research experience and guidance 
				from faculty and graduate student mentors.</p>
				<p>The program consists of 9-10 weeks of research in a laboratory, seminars on scientific research and career advancement, and social activities. Each REU 
				project has a clear research goal and is designed to involve the student in all aspects of the associated research activities. At the end of the REU program, 
				the student is invited to present the results of the conducted research in an oral or poster presentation at the annual in-house conference with 
				participants from the partnering institutions and representatives from industry.</p>
				<p>This REU program is funded by NSF's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCOR) Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) 
				program, Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (FEC) under the grant EPSCoR RII Track-2 FEC 1632891, entitled "<i>Probing and Understanding the 
				Brain: Micro and Macro Dynamics of Seizure and Memory Networks</i>" and awarded jointly to Louisiana Tech University, University of Alabama in 
				Birmingham and University of Arkansas for Medical Science in Little Rock. For more details on this grant visit <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=189466"><u>https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=189466</u></a>.</p>
